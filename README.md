# 3MD3070-DLMI - Classification of Lymphocytosis from Blood Cells

This is the repository of Quentin Blampey, Julien Duquesne and Cl√©ment Piat for the Kaggle Challenge 
in the scope of the course of Deep Learning for Medical Imaging.

To run a cross-validation and evaluate a model you can use `cross_validate.py` and specify as parameters the blocks and 
hyperparameters you want to use.

The default hyperparameters are those that generated our best submission.

To train a model from scratch and generate a submission on the test set, run `train.py`. 

The different blocks of the model are defined in `models/.
